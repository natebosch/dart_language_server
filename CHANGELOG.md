- Bug Fix: Set `implementationProvider` and `workspaceSymbolProvider` to `true`
  in server capabilities since these requests are now supported.

# 0.1.11+1

    order and don't put a timeout on the operations that impact file overlays.
  - Increase timeouts for other operations.
  - Flush logs on each message.

  given the other tweaks to how `didOpen` analysis roots are handled this
  shouldn't be as useful anymore.

# 0.1.3

- Add fixes to available code actions.
- Add support for `textDocument/rename`.

  package directory.
